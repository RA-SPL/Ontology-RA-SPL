# HHAI Submission 56 - Knowledge Modelling Documents  

## Interviews  
The four PDFs (*Distributed Cognition Theory Analysis with Aggregation - Subject #*) contain transcribed interviews (in Swedish), analyzed in two parts based on the Distributed Cognition Theory:  

1. **Part 1 (High Level Concepts).png:** The interviews were systematically deconstructed into key concepts within designated categories, such as roles, tasks, tools, information, rules, relationships, and risks. These are presented in the table to the right of the answers.  
2. **Part 2 (Hierarchical knowledge framework):** The cells under the answers, where rows are marked in blue, indicate the emergence of components with overarching classes, subclasses, relationships, and attributes.  

## Figures  
The figures (PNG files) include:  

1. **Part 1:** A categorized and summarized representation of the high-level concepts from Part 1.  
2. **Part 2:** A further aggregated knowledge framework, hierarchically divided into **Classes (and Subclasses), Object Properties** (relationships between classes), and **Data Properties** (attributes of classes).  

## Description Logics
